\textbf{\textit{NUMBER OF HOURS TO COMPLETE PS: Need to fill in still}}

% PROBLEM 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{(10 pt) Describe and explain each of the following (use examples):}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{The concept of interleaving instructions of two threads}}
\item{\textit{Each of the requirements for deadlock (give examples). Explain why the first three are necessary but not sufficient for deadlock.}}
\end{enumerate}

% PROBLEM 2
\item{\textit{(10 pt) Compare and contrast the following (make sure to define each of the items):}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{Mode switch vs process switch}}
\item{\textit{Semaphore vs conditional variable}}
\end{enumerate}

% PROBLEM 3
\item{\textit{(20 pt) Given the code below answer the following questions (explain your reasoning):}}
\begin{small}
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=5mm]
int temp;
void swap(int *y, int *z)
{
    int local;
    local = temp;
    temp = *y;
    *y = *z;
    *z = temp;
    temp = local;
}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{small}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{Is the function thread safe?}}
\item{\textit{Is the function reentrant?}}
\end{enumerate}

% PROBLEM 4
\item{\textit{(30 pt) Barrier Synchronization: A \textbf{barrier} is a tool for synchronizing the activity of a number of threads. When a thread reaches a \textbf{barrier point}, it cannot proceed until other threads have reached this point as well. When the last thread reaches the barrier point, all threads are released and can resume concurrent execution. 
You have a number of threads processing data and each piece of data takes a different amount of time to process. When a thread has completed its processing, it will ask for more work. However, the data requires that 4 workers all start together on the next 4 pieces of data. This means we want to gather 4 threads before having them begin processing. 
Please provide a solution (pseudocode), explain how it works, show that it is starvation free and deadlock free.}}

% PROBLEM 5
\item{\textit{(30 pt) CU wants to show off how politically correct it is by applying the U.S. Supreme
Court’s “Separate but equal is inherently unequal” doctrine to gender, ending its
long-standing practice of gender-segregated bathrooms on campus. However, as a
concession to tradition, it decrees that when a woman is in the bathroom, other women
may enter, but no men, and vice versa. Also, due to fire code, at most N (N > 1)
individuals may use the bathroom at any time. Your task is to write two functions:
\texttt{man\_use\_bathroom()} and \texttt{woman\_use\_bathroom()}. Provide a monitor-based solution
that manages access to the bathroom. Your solution should be fair, starvation free and
deadlock free.}}
