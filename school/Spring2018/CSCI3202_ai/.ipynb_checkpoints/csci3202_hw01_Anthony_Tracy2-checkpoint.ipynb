Implementing your own test cases as you develop codes is a good idea, and the `print` or `assert` statements are a nice and simple way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will generally provide `unittest` test cases at the end of each problem or assignment, so you have a sense of whether or not your code is working. The test cases for the remaining problems on this assignment will be defined at the bottom of the notebook, but code to run them will be provided within each problem (so you do not need to keep scrolling up and down the darn thing). The `unittest` framework is nice because it is modular and can be broken up into test cases for individual sections of codes. Of course, we could implement these test cases in `CodeRunner`, but learning how to implement `unittest`s in Jupyter is a useful skill.\n",
