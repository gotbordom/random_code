    "\n",
    "The first 3 methods are used to set up the environment, and populate it with things, or remove things from it:\n",
    "* constructor: we feed in the dimensions of a square grid environment, and subtract 1 from each to account for the fact that Python is 0-based, but we are sending in the number of tiles in each direction. The lower-left corner of the environment is assumed to be (0,0). The environment can also have `things` and `agents` in it, so we create a list for each of those.\n",
    "* `add_thing`: we want to be able to add things to the environment. Later, we will look at creating a class to represent `Thing`s.  We need as input to this a Thing and its location (Cartesian coordinates).\n",
    "* `remove_thing`: we might need to remove some things from the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next 3 methods are useful for representing agents' **sensors**. Namely, we are concerned about whether or not the agent can sense things at or near the agent.\n",
    "* `things_near`: we might be interested to know what are all the things in the tiles *adjacent* to the agent's location (as well as at the agent's location), so we return this as a list.\n",
    "* `things_at`: perhaps we have an agent that can only sense what is going on in its location (otherwise, the same as `things_near`)\n",
    "* `percepts`: by default in this generic `Environment` class, the agents will be able to perceive anything *near* them. We can override this later depending on if we think our agent should be able to sense more or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 3 methods to represent the agent moving through a 2D rectangular grid environment, as well as executing a couple other generic **actions**.\n",
    "* `hit_wall`: we know the boundaries of the environment, so if the agent tries to move outside of them, we need to let it know that it has bumped into a wall\n",
    "* `move`: the agent tries to execute a move\n",
    "* `execute_action`: here is the meat and cheese of the agent's actuators. In this generic class, we allow the agent to move in any of the four cardinal directions, as well as pick things up (`Grab`) and set things down (`Drop`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a few more methods to define how the actual simulation for the task environment is to proceed.\n",
    "* `is_done`: returns True if there are no more \"living\" agents to simulate\n",
    "* `step`: executes a single time step of the environment: the agent senses the environment, and then acts. This method by default is assuming a single agent, but we could override this to make it more general. You will notice that the `step` method is where we print output to the screen to stay apprised of what is going on in our virtual world.\n",

    "1. Implement a model-based agent\n",
    "  * Keep track of which tiles are clean/dirty\n",

    "  * For example, if the Roomba agent has just come from cleaning the tile at (0,0), and has now just cleaned the tile at (1,0), then the Roomba ought to know that going straight back to (0,0) is not the best option.\n",
    "  * You may want to add a **NoOp** (\"no operation\" or \"do nothing\") action choice, since moving around unnecessarily will worsen the agent's performance measure.\n",
    "1. Stochastically generate new dirt every so often\n",
    "  * Based on how long it has been since the agent last cleaned a particular tile, it may be necessary to circle back around and check the tiles again for dirt (since it may have appeared stochastically). Thus, the agent will need to track in its model *how long* it has been since it has cleaned each tile.\n",

Note that *all* tiles will need to be updated in this way, and that `p_dirt` is probably most appropriate to specify as an attribute of the environment."

The condo you will rent costs \\$240 per night, and there is a 3-night minimum stay.  Now suppose all 12 people are positive that they will stay for Friday and Saturday night. But some of the gang are slackers who don't have class until 4 PM on Monday, and they want to stick around for another half-day of skiing.  The decision we are going to analyze is this:  **how should we split up the cost among the 12 friends?**\n",

In decision analyses ranging from splitting the bill for a ski condo to managing a hydroelectric dam to estimating the \"correct\" height by which to augment the levees protecting New Orleans, people are going to disagree about the form of the loss function to assume. We will develop our decision analysis here using one form, but you are encouraged to revise it and try others out to see how the decision you arrive at might be affected by your choice of loss function.\n",
